 * Each MenuItem is a option for the Menu. There are different types of MenuItems for the developers to choose from
 * Say, the MenuItem glows when the mouse runs over; or it displays yes or no radio buttons when clicked.
 * 
 * The functionality of MenuItem can also be combined with the List to Map options implemented for user customized
 * button press setup etc. (TODO this still have to refactor some code in other classes)
